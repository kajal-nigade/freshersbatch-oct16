4. Create a list of numbers. Add them together. First double each number, then add 
them up. Compute their average.



def numList=[18,89,62,12,96,49]
sumList=numList.sum()
println ("Sum of the element is : "+ sumList)
doubleList=numList.collect{it*2}
println ("Double the list element : "+ doubleList)
doubleSum=doubleList.sum()
println ("Sum After Doubling the list : "+ doubleSum)

average=(sumList+doubleSum)/2
println ("Average of both the List : "+average)
